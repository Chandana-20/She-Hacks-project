Project Name : HANGMAN
Created by : Team Moxie


DESCRIPTION 

Hangman is an old school favorite,  word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words. You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.Use the keyboard to guess a letter .If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appears will be revealed. After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you lose a life and the hangman begins to appear, after 10 wrong guesses. Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.

METHOD 

We used the python module pygame to create the entire Hangman game. We used the wonderwords, a python package, to generate random words for the game. The letters of the randomnly generated word were made a list and the letters guessed by the player were made into another list. If the letter guessed by the player is present in the word, it will be displayed otherwise the parts of hangman start to appear.

TECHNOLOGIES USED :

Python

PROJECT OVERVIEW : 

As part of TinkerHub SheHacks we decided to do a project on making a Hangman game using Python. We utilised the pygame module of python to complete our project. First we made the basic outline of the game which included the wonderwords, a python package,  to get random words, images to finish the hangman step-by-step, a letter panel to choose the letters and blank lines to fill the letters. Then we chose a background image for the game and even included sound effects from freesounds.com
