PROJECT OVERVIEW
As part of TinkerHub SheHacks we decided to do a project on making a Hangman game using Python. We utilised the pygame module of python to complete our project. First we made the basic outline of the game which included the Wonderword module to get random words, images to finish the hangman step-by-step, a letter panel to choose the letters and blank lines to fill the letters. Then we chose a background image for the game and even included sound effects from freesounds.com
